# Create an NFT smart contract with HardHat

This project is based on [Create an NFT smart contract with HardHat](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/create-nft-smart-contract-with-hardhat). 

This is a simple NFT project that teaches how to use HardHat framwork for building NFT Projects. It also teaches how to write testcases for our smart contract and how to get our contract verified when deploying to the network.
